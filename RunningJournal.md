  <p>So apparently the title is showing, not the heading. Also seems like language is automatically in html, specifying created a weird doctype box</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Double check that this will run</li>
  <li>Insert a style.css file and figure out how that works outside of codeacademy.</li>
  <li>Keep nose to the grindstone</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Scratch that, this is all in markdown. For the moment need to get the html skills up a bit before worrying about this.</p>
